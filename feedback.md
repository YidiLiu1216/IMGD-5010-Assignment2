## FengKai:
As someone with almost no programming background, I find it a bit difficult to deduce the process, but I’ll try my best:
**Instructions:
Draw circles of different sizes at the center of the canvas, using the center as the coordinate origin to create line segments, where the other end of each segment corresponds to the radius coordinate of the circle.
The outer square blocks are assigned random values, random colors, and varying transparency within a certain range, and they rotate using the circle’s center as the coordinate reference.
However, I’m not quite clear about how the glitch effect is achieved.**
